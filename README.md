# Bankist Project

This is a demo project which was built to test run my acquired javascript skills.
It is a demo web bank app in which different transactions can be carried out on with getting response in return.
In this demo web app, 4 different accounts were created which a special username and password would be needed so as to gain access into the accounts.
In this web app, a loan can be requested for which in turn would be granted and also transfer can be made from one account to the other and also a deposit can also be made.
To test run, i'd leave the username and password of an account so as to enable viewers see the wonders of Javascript.
username: ao
password: 1111
